WAYVE
-----

*WAYVE* is an open-source code Python framework for the atmospheric perturbation model (APM).

The APM is an atmospheric perturbation model developed to simulate the interaction between wind farms and the atmosphere. It focuses on the generation and feedback effects of gravity waves. This code implements the model described in the following papers:
