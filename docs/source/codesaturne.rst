`code_saturne <https://www.code-saturne.org/cms/web/>`_ is a free open-source finite volume CFD solver for the Navier-Stokes equations, developped primarily by EDF. It solves the Navier-Stokes equations with scalar transport for 2D, 2D-axisymmetric, and 3D flows, whether steady or unsteady, laminar or turbulent, incompressible, dilatable, or weakly compressible, isothermal or not. 

code_saturne contains modules dedicated to specific physics, namely for atmospheric flows. A detailed description of the modelling possibilities, including the atmospheric module, can be found in `code_saturne's online documentation <https://www.code-saturne.org/cms/web/documentation/v80/>`_. This page focuses on the modelling assumptions and added source files allowing to handle wind farm flow modelling in the FLOW API.

This API can be launched with version 8.0 of code_saturne.
