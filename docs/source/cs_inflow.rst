Inflow Boundary Conditions
--------------------------
The Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) is parameterized by setting the system unknowns to a given vertical profile, at the domain boundaries and as initial state. If only the speed and direction at hub height are given, then the atmospheric profiles are extrapolated assuming a neutral stratification, using the Monin Obukhov Similarity theory.
